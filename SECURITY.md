## Vulnerability Management Plans


### Secure accounts with access

All users are required to use 2FA within the [Unc Inc](https://github.com/uncinc) Github organisation.

### Separation of Duties and Authorization
* Developers will only be granted access to repositories they manage.
* Administrative repo tasks will always be done by administrative users.

### Password Policies


#### Don't Use Passwords

We should opt for alternative authentication methods when possible:

* Asymmetric keys for connecting to servers.
* Delegated authentication (SAML, OAuth2, etc).
* Opaque access tokens.

#### SSH Keys

SSH keys should be rolled out selectively, providing developers access to only the servers that they require access to.


### Critical Updates And Security Notices

We learn about critical software updates and security threats from these sources

1. GitHub Security Alerts
2. GitHub: https://status.github.com/ & [@githubstatus](https://twitter.com/githubstatus)
